# AirKeeper
This tweaks allows you to globally block/allow domains, or granulary control the wireless connectivity and policy for apps and daemons. It consists two mode: persistent; and non-persistent. Persistent works in both non-jailbroken and jailbroken mode, and non-persistent only works in jailbroken mode.

All these are achieved with absolutely zero tweak hooking and make use of the private APIs in Apple's public NetworkExtension framework, so I would assume it would be quite efficient.
